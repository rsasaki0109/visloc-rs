# Bounded observation-based atlas refinement

Status: first strict BA policy measured and rejected for trajectory regression.
The [recovery foundation](openloris_atlas_landmark_integration.md) is merged as
[PR #71](https://github.com/rsasaki0109/visloc-rs/pull/71), after all eight CI
checks passed. Its RMSE/p95 remain above the frozen COLMAP acceptance gates.

## First controlled policy

- Default-off, one forward sweep, 60-frame windows with stride 30.
- Joint rig-pose/landmark BA using existing `BundleAdjustment`, rig observation
  factors and the sparse solver; at most 20 iterations per window.
- Intrinsics and sensor extrinsics remain fixed. Referenced poses outside the
  active window are fixed anchors; an explicit pose anchor handles windows
  without external anchors.
- Select every landmark touching an active frame and include all its
  observations, including those outside the window. Never silently truncate
  observations to satisfy a resource cap.
- Caps: 60 free poses, 16,384 landmarks, 262,144 observations and 1,024
  referenced poses. Over-cap windows are explicitly reported, not hidden.
- Validate finite, non-increasing full selected-observation cost and unchanged
  positive-depth / min-two-observation / mean-2-px / maximum-4-px track gates.
  Preserve supported images and rig frames. Apply a window transactionally;
  failed validation leaves the model unchanged.
- Keep one candidate problem at a time. No all-image dense system or copies of
  the complete model per window. GT is post-map evaluation only.

## Measured input footprint

A read-only scan of `recovery-v1/component-000/points3D.txt` grouped landmarks
by every 60-frame / stride-30 window containing one of their observations.
Every selected track's full observation list and referenced frame set counted
toward the footprint, not just its in-window observations. Frame IDs came from
the frozen rig manifest. Across 150 windows:

| Quantity | Maximum | Window start |
|---|---:|---:|
| Selected landmarks | 13,213 | 360 |
| All selected-track observations | 185,173 | 180 |
| Referenced rig poses | 593 | 420 |

This demonstrates input-size feasibility for the proposed caps, not measured
BA peak RSS or convergence. Sparse factorization, total process RSS, exact
repeatability and unchanged default output still require execution checks.
If strict validation rejects every window, retain that evidence and diagnose
the failure; do not relax the frozen COLMAP acceptance gates.

## First measured result

The implementation passes 23 example tests. In the 10k control, 8 of 150 main
windows were accepted and none of 17 tail windows were accepted. Main-component
support files and all six tail output files remain byte-identical to recovery.
The main component took 120.50 s at 520,228 KiB peak RSS; the tail took 11.34 s.
These are integration/recovery/BA-only times, not mapper or native E2E results.

Aggregate mean reprojection improves to 0.631996 px, but RMSE/p95 worsen from
0.391465/0.643175 m to 0.391797/0.643537 m. The policy is **not promoted**.
Early rejection diagnostics show that lower total cost can still move an
individual track beyond its mean-2-px or maximum-4-px gate. Complete logs and
exact hashes are in
[first BA evidence](../benchmarks/electro/m8-openloris-atlas-joint-ba-v1.json).
The next decision must examine rejected observations and existing post-BA
filter/retriangulation behavior, not treat lower residual cost as trajectory
success or loosen the frozen COLMAP target.

## Connectivity changes the next diagnostic

An independent rig-frame/landmark graph audit finds two disconnected groups
inside the atlas main file: frames 0–1999 and 2000–4493. The tail is one group.
COLMAP's explicit frame assignments and tracks yield one 4,494-frame main
group and one 505-frame tail group. Thus all 4,999 frames having observations
and being published in two files is not enough to establish connectivity parity.
The first BA policy preserves this split. Before changing BA filtering, trace
which source tracks cross frame 1999/2000 and where integration loses them.
See [connectivity evidence](../benchmarks/electro/m8-openloris-atlas-connectivity-v1.json).

The source trace finds 31 cross-boundary point rows, all in node 25 (window
start 1950). All pass ownership merging (19 new / 12 extended, no collision
rejection), but no crossing track survives final atlas-pose triangulation.
An independent row-level replay attributes failures to reprojection or depth,
not absent input matches. The next bounded audit compares source/atlas pose
ownership and left/right-only triangulations, deduplicated by final union track
identity.

That follow-up confirms 31 distinct merged tracks. Left-only triangulation
passes for 14, right-only for 16, and both sides for 7, without changing any
geometry gate. The left anchors provide at least six distinct 3D-track
correspondences in 14 right-side frames (maximum 11 per frame). These are
resection candidates, not yet verified GeneralizedPnP recoveries.

Frame 1999 uses node 25 and frame 2000 uses node 8. However, the 0.261 m jump
at 1997/1998 is internal to node 25, and the 0.900 m jump at 2022/2023 is
internal to node 8. A single rigid shift of the entire later component cannot
explain all three discontinuities. The next default-off diagnostic therefore
uses existing GeneralizedPnP on bounded per-frame candidates, independently
checks cross-track recovery and loss of existing support, and does not publish
new poses automatically. GT remains evaluation-only.

For subsequent policy design, the upstream
[COLMAP local BA implementation](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/main/src/colmap/sfm/incremental_mapper.cc)
refines a local bundle, completes/merges tracks, then filters observations.
That is different from rejecting a whole window when any track exceeds a
gate. The existing visloc `filter_positioned_track_observations` likewise
filters observations after BA. These are references for a future controlled
experiment, not evidence that filtering alone will recover missing connectivity.
