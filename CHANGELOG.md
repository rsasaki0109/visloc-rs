# Changelog

All notable changes to `visloc-rs` will be documented here.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- **`gsplat_photos` damps its intrinsics refinement from the start.** The
  joint pose + intrinsics BA after the mapper starts Levenberg–Marquardt at
  λ = 1e4 instead of 1e-4. The damping is absolute and a photo set's
  Hessian diagonals are 1e4–1e8, so 1e-4 was no damping: its first steps
  swung cameras by up to a radian and were rejected until λ reached that
  scale.
  - **Three 500-image SmallCity pass-1 subsets**, camera centres against
    the release's COLMAP model (Sim(3) refit on errors under three times
    the median), median / p90 / max:

    | Subset | before | after |
    |---|---|---|
    | 0–499 | 13.6 / 22.6 / 282 cm (4 cameras over 1 m) | 12.1 / 17.3 / 23 cm (none) |
    | 500–999 | 23.8 / 29.2 / 66 cm | 24.9 / 30.8 / 69 cm |
    | 1000–1499 | 8.6 / 16.1 / 22 cm | 7.9 / 15.2 / 21 cm |

  - **ETH3D DSLR, all 13 training scenes** (one camera per scene, 1,600 px,
    the focal started 5% off, ground-truth poses): the same images register
    and the scores barely move. Means over the scenes before → after:
    relative rotation 0.084° → 0.085°, camera-centre median 0.76 → 0.79 cm,
    p90 1.38 → 1.42 cm, maximum 3.99 → 3.86 cm. meadow is the largest
    change either way (median 4.0 → 4.5 cm), then facade (1.71 → 1.61 cm),
    office (maximum 6.4 → 4.3 cm) and playground (0.26 → 0.30 cm); seven
    scenes are unchanged.
  - **Why the first subset needed it:** the mapper starts from images 66
    and 324, a revisit 3.5 m apart, because consecutive photos are too
    close for COLMAP's 16° initial-pair angle. Its model leaves image 66
    32 m off and images 319–352 bent by up to 29 m; the refinement pulls
    them back, and with the damping it no longer stops halfway. Starting
    from nearby photos instead (an 8° initial-pair angle, or a pair at most
    30 photos apart) avoids the bend but leaves a 18 cm median on that
    subset: the revisit pair also closes the loop, so neither is used.

### Added

- **Prebuilt binaries on every release** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).
  A `v*` tag push creates the GitHub release from that version's CHANGELOG
  section and attaches `gsplat_photos`, `visloc_mvs` (the `mvs` example),
  `colmap_incremental_mapper` and `visloc_web`, built with their GPU
  features, for Linux x86_64 (built on Ubuntu 22.04, glibc 2.35), Windows
  x86_64 and macOS on Apple silicon, as `.tar.gz` / `.zip` with SHA-256
  sums. A manual run (`workflow_dispatch`, input `tag`) builds an existing
  tag, e.g. `v0.3.0`.

## 0.3.0 - 2026-10-24

### Highlights

- **Multi-view stereo: `visloc-mvs` (new crate).** Dense point clouds and
  meshes from a COLMAP model, on the CPU or on the GPU through wgpu. On
  the ETH3D high-res training set (13 scenes at 3,200 px, one NVIDIA L4)
  F1 at 2 cm is 83.7%, against the 83.42% ACMMP reports; against
  ACMMP's released code on the same L4, 83.4% against 83.2% over six
  scenes, in 27.5 minutes against 110. From the photos end to end,
  76.3% against 57.4% for COLMAP 4.2.1 CUDA over the 10 scenes both
  finished, in 58 minutes against 372.
- **City-scale photos to splats.** The README hero is Hierarchical 3DGS
  SmallCity: 5,822 photos, 5,583 registered, 4.7M gaussians and a
  5.9M-triangle mesh from one `gsplat_photos` command in 2.5 h on a Colab
  A100. Along the way: VLFeat-compatible SIFT on the GPU (SmallCity's
  photos in 43.8 s on an RTX 3090), optional GPU bundle adjustment, a
  converged final BA, completion of the largest model, and a COLMAP-port
  mapper more than twice as fast with about half the memory (SmallCity
  peak 9.0 GiB instead of 18.9 GiB).
- **SfM ahead of COLMAP 4.2.1 on ETH3D.** On COLMAP's matches of the 13
  DSLR training scenes the mapper scores a mean AUC@1°/3°/5° of
  53.69 / 79.94 / 86.90 (452 of 454 images), against 51.34 / 76.25 /
  82.88 for COLMAP's incremental mapper and 48.65 / 70.41 / 76.36 for
  its global mapper.
- **360° panoramas.** `gsplat_photos --equirect` (the six cube faces of a
  panorama as one rig) and `--equirect-native` (COLMAP 4.1's
  `EQUIRECTANGULAR` camera); `gsplat_train` trains on equirectangular
  COLMAP models.
- **New ways in.** `visloc_web` runs the photo pipeline from a browser;
  Python bindings (`bindings/python`, package `visloc`); ROS 2 nodes
  (`ros2/visloc-ros2`) for the VIO and localization.
- **Sensors and fusion.** Multi-camera Basalt VIO for divergent rigs
  (opt-in), monocular-inertial VIO (experimental), and a joint GNSS +
  visual-odometry pose graph.
- **Lens models in bundle adjustment.** Pose/structure BA and rig BA use
  each camera's full distortion model; tangential distortion can be
  self-calibrated (opt-in).

## 0.2.1 - 2026-10-08

Patch release: camera-distortion correctness fixes. Each fix below corrected
results that were silently wrong, not just errors that were reported.

### Fixed

- **COLMAP camera export with self-calibrated distortion.** A `Pinhole`
  camera carrying the refined radial `[k1, k2]` tail
  (`--refine-distortion`) was written as `PINHOLE` with 6 params, which is
  not valid COLMAP (`PINHOLE` has 4); COLMAP rejects it and other readers
  silently drop the distortion. Every COLMAP writer (text and binary) now
  exports it as `OPENCV` with `p1 = p2 = 0` (the identical projection), and
  fallible writers reject any camera whose parameter count does not match its
  COLMAP model. New public helper `visloc_io::colmap::colmap_camera_record`.
- **OPENCV tangential distortion.** `Camera::project` / `normalize_pixel` /
  `unit_ray_from_pixel` ignored `p1, p2` of an `OpenCv` camera, so a COLMAP
  `OPENCV` model with non-zero tangential terms was silently treated as
  radial-only. Such cameras now use the full Brown-Conrady model (shared with
  `FULL_OPENCV`, k3..k6 = 0); results with `p1 = p2 = 0` are bit-identical to
  before. New `Camera::tangential_distortion`.
- **Pose/structure BA ignored self-calibrated radial distortion.** With
  `refine_intrinsics = false` (e.g. the SfM polish / warm-start passes after
  `--refine-distortion`), `optimize_weighted` built its residuals and
  Jacobians with an undistorted pinhole while the cost it accepts steps
  against used the distorted `Camera::project`, so LM optimised a different
  model than it measured and could stall. The monocular residual and Jacobian
  (serial, parallel, and dense-QR assembly, plus the GNC residual vector) now
  apply `1 + k1·r² + k2·r⁴` with an analytic Jacobian; distortion-free cameras
  keep the historical closed form bit-for-bit.

### Added

- **`BaConfig::shared_focal` / `--shared-focal`** (unordered and sequential
  SfM demos): constrain intrinsics self-calibration to `fx == fy`. Previously
  `fx` and `fy` were always refined independently, so weakly observable
  motion (near-pure forward translation) could settle on a spurious aspect
  ratio. Default off; the joint solve is unchanged when it is not set.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-09-15

### Highlights

- **Real-data SfM at scale.** All ten ETH3D low-resolution many-view scenes:
  **9,996/10,008 cameras registered (99.88%)**, with no mapper run above
  3.32 GiB. Same-input ETH3D Electro 1,200 runs **3.46× faster than COLMAP**
  with **25.2% lower** camera-centre RMSE, and the 38-image courtyard control
  reaches **0.5379 cm vs COLMAP's 1.6166 cm**.
- **Visual-Inertial SLAM (faithful Basalt Rust port).** A tightly-coupled
  stereo-inertial VIO estimator plus offline mapper that matches native
  Basalt's ATE within **0.1%** on all 11 EuRoC sequences and, with EuRoC's
  official calibration, beats measured ORB-SLAM3 on **8 of 11** sequences.
- **COLMAP-compatible unordered SfM** with VLAD retrieval, essential-matrix
  verification, incremental mapping, connected-component models, and COLMAP
  text export for downstream 3DGS / MVS.
- **Online stereo SLAM** with loop closure, SE(3)/Sim(3) pose-graph
  optimization, GNC outlier rejection, and bundle adjustment, benchmarked on
  KITTI, EuRoC, and TUM RGB-D.
- **Opt-in deep frontend** (SuperPoint / LightGlue via in-Rust ONNX Runtime,
  CUDA-accelerated), plus public-data map-reuse localization and GNSS-prior
  tracking demos.
